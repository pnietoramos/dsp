[Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2004.html#toc31) (actual vs. biased)

The computed mean values are:

Unbiased mean: 1.024205155043831
Biased mean: 2.403679100664282

This is a huge difference.The change in distribution is particularli dramatic for 0 children. The biased distributions present a 0 probability for that value instead of the value the unbiased value (0.47).
